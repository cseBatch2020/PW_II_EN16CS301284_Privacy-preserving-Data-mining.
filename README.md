Privacy-Preserving Data Mining (PPDM) is a data mining and statistical databases innovative field where data mining algorithms are analyzed for side-effects in data privacy. It is also called privacyenhanced/privacy-sensitive data mining dealing with getting valid data mining results without learning underlying data values. This reveals how many different methods and techniques can be used in a PPDM context from a technical perspective.
